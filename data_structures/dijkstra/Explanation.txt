Roadtrip Explanation:

For my scores, I rated the destinations on a 0-5 scale. For scenery,
0 was terrible scenery, while 5 was beautiful. For traffic, 0 was
none at all, while 5 was heavy traffic. For attractions, 0 was no
fun or cool attractions, while 5 was the most fun and coolest
attractions. As for my CalculateWeight algorithm, I wanted the values
mean something to me. To me, traffic and attractions are very important,
so I just added those two together. Then, I added the product of
scenery and distance because if I am driving a long distance, then
the scenery is VERY important.

When going between Chapel Hill and LA, I will hit Chicago, then San Francisco,
and then LA. When going from Chapel Hill to Chicago the weight is 790.0,
when going from Chicago to San Francisco the weight is 8.0, and when going from
San Francisco to LA, the weight is 396.0. On my way to LA, I will visit some
overpasses in the West Virginia mountains, some national forests, the Golden Gate
Bridge, as well as go to a Chicago Cubs baseball game, a San Francisco 49ers
football game, and a LA Lakers basketball game.
